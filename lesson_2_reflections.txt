What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a .git hidden folder and starts storing
metadata for all the changes that occur within the directory.
That's necessary to track all the various version control functionality
from the point of initialization going forward.  Without it, no git historical
functionality to work with.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area includes the tracked files (as opposed untracked files in the working
directory).  Allows you to rehearse individual file additions before adding them to a commit.  Staging area is almost a different temporary virtual working directory, and exists just outside the repository before files begin to be tracked in the
repository.
