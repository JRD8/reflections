When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories are best for sharing code to multiple potential contributors.  Its
also useful to use a cloud based storage backup resource.  Also good for programming
while traveling so one can always have access to code no matter what/where computer
one is working on.
