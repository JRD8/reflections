When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories are best for sharing code to multiple potential contributors.  Its
also useful to use a cloud based storage backup resource.  Also good for programming
while traveling so one can always have access to code no matter what/where computer
one is working on.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You want to perhaps keep some changes private before "publishing" them to a public 
or shared respitory where other collaborators can both pull your code and make
further changes.  Also, you may way to test your code or keep different copies 
locally before committing to updating those same commits on the cloud backup.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clones are making a direct copy of an existing repository - can happen either
locally or from github to a local machine.  Branches occur within a depository.
These are generally done locally and not directly on GitHub.  Forking is when 
you want to clone a 3rd prty repository and make changes for your own personal
use.
